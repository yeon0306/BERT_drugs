"""I started taking Effexor XR 37.5mg capsules 2 months ago.  I had a hard time for the first couple of days.  I would wake up in the mornings feeling afraid and hot.  But my loved ones convinced me to stick it out.  I continued taking my medicine each day...at the same time each morning.  And I wish I would have started taking it a long time ago!  I can concentrate.  I can focus on what my children are saying to me.  Things that used to be overwhelming are no longer.  I can go out in public and feel confident...not feel like the walls are closing in on me.  Effexor XR changed my life for the better.""",0

"""I'm 49 years old and I started having panic attacks and anxiety again. It first started when I had a surgery to extract my thyroid many years ago. I tried other medications but Citalopram was the only one that made me feel good again. I have been taking 20 mg for  more than 2 years and the only side effect I have is dry mouth. Actually I do not even realize it. I can't imagine flying or staying in closed places without taking it.""",0
"""I have been on this since the beginning of October 2015..
I never really write any reviews.. but I swear this drug saved my life. . I am a pro athlete and my migraines had got so bad I couldn't train any more.  Almost a year went by with no training. . It got to the point that I was going into the hospital at least once a week. . CT scans and Mri. . The whole 9 yards.  Finally the ER Dr told me I should really consider taking this so I did.  Within 2 weeks I was migraine free. . And haven't had one since. It is truly a life saver. I am also finding that I am in a better place mentally as well.""",0

"""After 16 years of opioid and heroin addiction I had tried everything. Methadone for 3years and off and on suboxone for 8 or more years, i tried hard to get off suboxone and it was horrid withdrawal so I relapsed on heroin.  When I knew I might die if I kept it up, I put myself into a detox and planed to leave after. Stayed for rehab and the vivitrol was suggested I went back and fourth with my decision because I still wanted to drink. Finally I decided to get the shot. Side Effects: muscle spasms, constant stretching that felt great,  decreased appetite, weight loss. The interactions with my 3mgs of clozepam are hard to explain. It's a high definitely but not one I like to much. If I take Bental for the stomac cramps I get really dipped out""",0
"""I'm married, 34 years old and I have no kids. Taking the pill was such a hassle so I decided to get the Mirena. It was very painful when it was inserted,then had cramping for the rest of that day! For the first 6 weeks I spotted off and on and then my periods just stopped. I still got cramps every few months, but never needed to take anything. The 5th and final year of me having Mirena, I started to spot monthly. I called my OB, they just said that the levonorgestrel wears off over time. I made the decision that I was going to have another one put in. Taking the old one out didn't hurt at all, you feel a little pressure. Inserting the new one was less painful but still uncomfortable. It's been 4 days and I still have a little cramping but overall HAPPY.""",0

My breats got noticeably larger within the first few weeks and I gained about 10 pounds, but I'm a thin girl anyway so I gladly take on the extra few pounds and curves.

"""I have taken Tamoxifen for 5 years. Side effects are severe sweating and depression. I have been taking Effexor XR longer than I have been on Tamoxifen. My Oncologist increased the Effexor dosage from 75 mg to 150 mg per day. She assure me the Effexor and Black Cohoosh would STOP the sweating...NOT.

First, I'd like to mention that you can NOT take this drug for a week or less and expect to magically feel better; I felt really sick the first two weeks on this drug. But you HAVE to give the drug time. For me, I didn't really start noticing the drugs positive effects for about two months. I took Zoloft before this and felt like it made me too tired and absent-minded. Luckily, Lexapro doesn't seem to have this effect (although I do drink caffeinated drinks). I like Lexapro not only because my anxiety and depression is completely gone, but I feel like I can finally handle everything in my life now (I'm a working full-time college student). I highly recommend this drug.""",0

I have suffered with depression my whole life (I am 41) and only finally got help after being admitted to a psychiatric facility. The first two weeks on Wellbutrin were horrible. I had severe anxiety and gastrointestinal issues. I ate broth and crackers for a week! But every single side effect was gone in about 3 weeks. I sure know it doesnt work for everyone, but it certainly has for me. I know it can be scarey to try new medication, but give it a go; it might be the one for you.""",0
"""I love this pill and I'm surprised it has so many poor reviews on this website, but I guess it really goes to show you that it's all about finding a form of birth control that works for you. For me, Mononessa is just that. PROS: Cheap (I only pay about $10/month, but I was getting it free for a while) with no negative emotional or mental effects (I find this pill actually increases my mood!). I used to have extremely painful cramps on the first two days of my period, but that pain has dramatically decreased since taking this pill. Lingering acne on my face has also vanished. CONS: Occasional light spotting with a small breakout a week or so before period. I have gained a few extra pounds, but I've managed most of it with diet and exercise.""",0
"""I have taken Yasmin for 4 months. 1st month had increased acne, headaches, nausea, tender breasts and slight irritability. Half way through 2nd month skin started to improve and side effects stopped. My period came on 2nd day of taking white placebo pill. Usually the week before my period I have painful cramps and have to take pain killers, this time there was no bloating or cramps and pain. On the 3rd month and my skin is starting to heal and look a lot clearer, periods are normal and pain free.  Only mild discomfit half an hour before my period starts. Yasmin will make your skin breakout when you first start taking it, but it will start to improve. After I wash my makeup off I can't believe how clear my skin is.""",0
"""Just started taking Vyvanse. Before I was taking Adderall 30mg XR and I'll tell you Vyvanse works so much better. Vyvanse stays active until it wears off. The only bad part is, sometimes it will stop working for like 5 minutes and then it will start working wonders again. It helps me get my work done and it helps me stay in control and very focused all day long while I'm working. Before I started taking Vyvanse I couldn't concentrate what so ever. And I would never get my work done. It also makes me feel the best that I have ever felt in my whole life. If it wasn't for Vyvanse I would probably be fired. I'm 24 and I finally get to enjoy life. To the people who made Vyvanse god bless you.""",0

I would sweat so badly that my hair, legs feet, hands and face would get wet...so disgusting.  It would take me a while to dry off.  I started this patch on Monday and within 12 hours, I noticed a difference and within 24 hours, the wet sweats were gone.  I have to keep all the fans on in my house and have an industrial fan that I would stand in front of during my flashes.  Yesterday ( day 2), I did not have to turn on a single fan and my wet sweats are completely gone. I only had a headache the first night and now I feel fantastic and normal.  I still have the occasional hot flash but it is short and I don't break out in a sweat.""",0

"""I've been on Belviq for 7 weeks and have lost 17 lbs already! I have hypothyroidism so I have been unable to lose weight despite trying (and sticking with) pretty much every weight loss diet or supplement available. Belviq was a last resort and I am so glad I tried it. I did have some mild headaches the first few days and my brain seemed to be on overdrive. I actually had trouble sleeping initially although most reviewers say they slept better after trying Belviq.

I am also doing the Fast Diet (5:2 diet) 2 non-consecutive days of the week so I do think that helps. I had been doing the Fast Diet 4 months prior to starting Belviq, but only was losing about a 1/2 lb a week.. so the Fast Diet is not very impressive on it's own.""",0

I never miss a week and as I injected more and more, the side effects have lessened to the point that with Vicodin I can work well on my injection days. I cannot sleep thru the night on an injection.

Injections in the tummy are much less painful than injections in the upper thighs, and leaving the pen out for 30-60 minutes before injecting probably helps (I have never injected without doing this, so I can't say either way).
